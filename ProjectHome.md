<b>A note for the people accessing the link above from China:</b>

It seems that www.android-x86.org may not be able to be accessed from China sometimes. If you can not access www.android-x86.org, you can still get the latest images from this page. I will keep this page synced with android-x86.org as close as possible. If you have problems/questions, please go to android-x86 discussion group at <b><a href='http://groups.google.com/group/android-x86'>http://groups.google.com/group/android-x86</a></b>. You can also join our IRC channel at irc.freenode.net #android-x86<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if git.android-x86.com can be accessed from China or not. If you see the problem to access it from China, please send me an e-mail.<br>
